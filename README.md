## Goal: To apply knowledge of React to build an eCom store.

We were tasked with build out the following pages for an eCom store:

- Homepage: should have a list of all the products. There should be a look-ahead search bar that filters products when typing in a product name. Clicking on a product should take a user to an individual product page.

- Individual product page: should display data for a single product. There should be an Add to cart button which, upon clicking, adds the product to the cart. The product page should display the title of the product, the description and the image. There should also be reviews listed for the product, if there are any. You should use the discountedPrice property to display the price of the product. If there is a difference between the discountedPrice and price properties then that means there is a discount for that product. Calculate what this discount is and display it on the page.

- Cart page: Clicking on the Cart icon will load the Cart page, which will list all of the products as well as a total. The Cart page will have a Checkout button. Clicking this Checkout button then goes to a Checkout success page.
  
- Checkout success page: will display a message to the user notifying them that their order was successful. There should also be a link that lets a user go back to the store. The cart must be cleared if the user gets to the Checkout success page.
  
- Contact page: will contain a contact form with the following fields. There must be form validation:

Full name (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)
Subject (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)
Email (Must be a valid email address, required)
Body (Minimum number of characters is 3, required)

You will be using React Router to switch between pages.
